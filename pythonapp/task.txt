Write a function that provides a weather summary for a given city based on a forecast for the next 2 weeks.

More specifically the function should:
- Accept a city name as a parameter.
- Return a dictionary containing the following information.
  * The name of the city requested.
  * Max temperature over the forecast period.
  * Min temperature over the forecast period.
  * A list of dates in 'yyyy-mm-dd' format grouped by the weather forecast.

eg
>>> summarise_forecast('London')
{
	'city': 'London',
	'max': 80.82, 
	'min': 64.6,
 	'forecasts': {
 		'Clear': ['2014-07-24', '2014-07-25'],
 		'Rain': ['2014-07-26'],
 	}
 }
 
Hints:
- The data can be retrieved at runtime using the openweathermap.org REST API.
- Example: GET http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?q=London&units=imperial&cnt=14
- If using json formatted data the fields within each day’s forecast you may need are:
  * date (in "time since epoch" format) = “dt”
  * max temp = temp[“max”]
  * min temp = temp[“min”]
  * forecast = weather[“main”]
  
  
Feel free to use any 3rd party libraries to you need and include a pip requirements file.

Good luck.
